	<h1>Daryl Holman Jr.</h1>
	<h2>I'm a recent graduate of Eastern Michigan, having only lived in New York City for three months. I enjoy short walks on the beach and low priced food.</h2>
	<p>Professionally, my passion is in assisting in the outreach of social enterprises, nonprofits and Black owned businesses. Outside of work I like going on vacations, learning new things and being active!</p>
	<p>Through this course, I hope to learn more of Java and promming for phone applications.</p>
